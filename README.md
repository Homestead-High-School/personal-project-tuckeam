Replace this with a daily detail of what you have learned/done.
This detail should be well formatted, google how-to-create github wiki for more information

**11/8:** I learned more about functions, scope of variables, classes, and objects.

Example of function that creates a vector of the first 3 multiple of a number and returns them in a vector, similar to an arraylist

This function is defined and initialized in the main file, but they can also be defined and written in other files.

**11/7:** I learned about while loops(same as java), for loops(same as java), vectors, and functions.

Example of a while loop that gives the user 50 tries to guess a number

**11/5:** I learned about outputs, compile and execute,variables, comments, and user input.

-cout<< is used to display information

You have to compile code in the terminal using g++ file name

-comments are the same as java and variables are similar except String-->string and boolean-->bool

cin<< is used to get user input

**11/4:** I found tutorials to learn c++ and decided on tic tac toe as a final project.

Week 1 reflection: I originally had trouble coming up with a project, but then I decided on a spot it game using java. I realized a spot it would not implement anything new, so I switched to learning c++ and making a tic tac toe game. Though I didn't stick with my original plan, learning and practicing c++ is going well because it is similar to java.
