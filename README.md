11/7: I learned about while loops. for lopps, vectors, and functions.

11/5: I learned about outputs, compile and execute,variables, comments, and user input.

11/4: I found tutorials to learn c++ and decided on tic tac toe as a final project.

Week 1 reflection: I originally had trouble coming up with a project, but then I decided on a spot it game using java. I realized a spot it would not implement anything new, so I switched to learning c++ and making a tic tac toe game. Though I didn't stick with my original plan, learning and practicing c++ is going well because it is similar to java.
