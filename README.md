**11/16:**<ins>cleaned up tic tac toe program and worked on presentation</ins>

**11/15:**<ins>MSOE practice questions, java kahoot, and worked on main and checkTie program of tic tac toe program</ins>

**11/14:**<ins>addLetter method to change board and started methods to check if there is a winner.</ins>

**11/11:**<ins>practice and start tic tac toe</ins>

**11/10:**<ins>class practice plan tic tac toe </ins>

**11/9:** <ins>default arguments, inline functions, overloaded functions, templates for overloaded functions, and destructors:</ins>

If a method is getting called multiple times with a common parameter you can use default arguments then call it with no arguments and it will use the default

-Overloaded functions do the same thing, but with different variable types, but templates allow you to write one method that takes multiple types

Example of a template.

-Destructors are the opposite of constructors(they gets rid of objects)

Destructor declaration(in song.hpp):

Destructor definition(in song.cpp):

**11/8:** <ins>functions, scope of variables, classes, and objects:</ins>

Getter and setter declaration(in .hpp)

Example of function that creates a vector of the first 3 multiple of a number and returns them in a vector, similar to an arraylist

This function is defined and initialized in the main file, but they can also be defined and written in other files.

**11/7:** <ins>while loops(same as java), for loops(same as java), vectors, and functions:</ins>

Example of a while loop that gives the user 50 tries to guess a number

Vectors can be initialized right away or declared and values can be added using name.push_back(value)

**11/5:** <ins>outputs, compile and execute,variables, comments, and user input:</ins>

-cout<< is used to display information

You have to compile code in the terminal using g++ file name

-comments are the same as java and variables are similar except String-->string and boolean-->bool

cin<< is used to get user input

**11/4:** <ins>finding tutorials and planning:</ins>

Week 1 reflection: I originally had trouble coming up with a project, but then I decided on a spot it game using java. I realized a spot it would not implement anything new, so I switched to learning c++ and making a tic tac toe game. Though I didn't stick with my original plan, learning and practicing c++ is going well because it is similar to java.
